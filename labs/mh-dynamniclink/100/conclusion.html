Dynamnic linking assists with saving on space and keeps repetive updates/data down. The enviroment variable LD_PRELOAD has many uses, some of which are useful and some might be used against the user. It might be used by malware, so being aware of its presence and checking for any new data inputted into it could be a good security habit. Generally, if an attacker can modify that enviroment variable there is already a few issues, but it allows for different behaivors that might make it harder to detect issues immediately, see rootkits for example. Although this vulnerablity requires local access to a machine, it is still notable as it could be hard to detect a change in the variable unless you specifically look for it.
