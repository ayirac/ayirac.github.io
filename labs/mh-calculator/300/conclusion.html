The examination of integer overflows in this lab underscores the persistent and consequential nature of this common programming flaw. As evidenced by historical incidents such as the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine in the 1980s and the Boeing 787 electrical system in 2015, integer overflows have the potential to cause serious harm, from fatal outcomes to critical system failures. In the context of security, integer overflows become particularly precarious when user-provided inputs can trigger unexpected behavior. The lab has highlighted the imperative of scrutinizing code for vulnerabilities, especially in scenarios where arithmetic operations are conducted without rigorous input validation.

The consequences of integer overflows can manifest in tangible issues such as buffer overflows, where excessive data can overwrite adjacent memory. This, in turn, can lead to the compromise of critical data structures, manipulation of program flow, or even the execution of arbitrary code. The general stability of the system is at risk to Denial of Service attacks and parts or all of the program halting. These specific issues underscore the gravity of addressing integer overflows promptly and comprehensively. Mitigation strategies involve diligent input validation, careful selection of data types, and the implementation of safeguards to prevent overflow vulnerabilities.
