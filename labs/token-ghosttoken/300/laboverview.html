Token architectures can be complex and vulnerablities can exist in the system design that is a result of some quality of life improvement. In this lab, we explore a file directory webserver that allows token based resource lookup, along with a vulnerable account deletion recovery that allows an attacker to gain access to a system and stay hidden.
