This lab showcased a similar vulnerablity to The GhostToken vulnerability, discovered by Astrix's Security Research Group on June 19, 2022, exposed a critical flaw in Google's Cloud Platform (GCP), impacting all Google users. This 0-day vulnerability, now patched by Google as of April 7, 2023, allowed threat actors to manipulate an OAuth application, making it invisible and unremovable from the victim's Google account. By exploiting this flaw, attackers could access sensitive user data and maintain persistent unauthorized access. The attack involved deleting and restoring the GCP project associated with the OAuth application, creating a recurring "ghost" token that could be used to compromise the victim's account. In general, it is important to be mindful of the full system at hand when adding developing a product.
