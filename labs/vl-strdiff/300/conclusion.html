The consequences of overlooking buffer overflow vulnerabilities are far-reaching. Stack overflows, illustrated in the lab through an intentionally vulnerable library, can lead to the compromise of critical data structures and even the execution of arbitrary code. The potential for a stack overflow attack resulting from unchecked buffers highlights the urgency of secure coding practices, especially when utilizing external libraries.

As witnessed in this lab, the exploitation of buffer overflows often leads to unauthorized access to functions, such as the unreachable secret function 'bar()'. However, an attacker also execute code injected in via the buffer, leading to more precise and deadly malicious code running. Consequences of a buffer overflow could lead to data being stolen, overwritten, or a cascading effect of segmentation faults that might result in unpredictable behaivors.
