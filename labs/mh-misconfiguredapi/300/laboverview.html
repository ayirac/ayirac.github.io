In this lab, you will explore the linux enviroment variable LD_PRELOAD, which allows a user to specify a directory or file to preload a shared library in front of system specified shared libraries. An attacker could leverage this feature to preload vulnerale library function code, perhaps targetting a specific function they wish to 'overwrite'.
