The absence or improper configuration of the Cache-Control HTTP header poses a potential security risk, enabling attackers with access to a user's system to exploit browser caches and access sensitive conversations. The vulnerablity has impacted Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Outlook in the past as a result of misconfigurations leading to unauthorized data exposure, and is generally a common error for new web developers. Being mindful of the potentially misleading directives, such as no-cache, is vital and can pop up in a hobby project, community projects, or even commercial products. In a more general sense, being aware of all HTTP headers at your disposal will prevent other security issues occuring with the lack or misconfiguration of a HTTP header.
