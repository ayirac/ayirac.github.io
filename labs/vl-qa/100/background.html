The statement below selects all columns from the user table given the NAME variable matches the selected $name. Since the variable is directly in the statement, it is possible to inject more data than intended by the developer.
<br>&emsp;SELECT * FROM users WHERE NAME='$name';
<br>&emsp;Malicious input to exploit the above statement: input Joe' OR 1=1;#

The OR 1=1 statement will calculate to always true, causing this statement to always execute without considering the other conditions. The ;# will close the statement and comment out the rest of the code.
